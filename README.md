I’m **Fahad Waseem**, a **Software & Data-focused Engineer with 3 years of hands-on experience** working on real-world systems, automation, and data-driven solutions. I graduated from **Superior University** and focus on building practical, production-ready software rather than purely academic projects.

I prefer working with clear requirements, structured data, and maintainable logic—especially in backend, automation, and data workflows.
